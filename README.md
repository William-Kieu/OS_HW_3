# OS_HW_3
Logical to physical address conversion

This program simulates a basic memory management system by translating logical addresses into physical addresses using a page/frame table. It implements the translation logic and handles page faults appropriately.


Functionality
The program performs the following tasks:
  Initializes a hard coded page/frame table data structure.
  Defines a translation function to convert logical addresses to physical addresses.
  Detects faults by checking if the page number is present in the page/frame table.
  Prints information about the logical and physical addresses, including page numbers and offsets.

Instructions for execution
  Move Source.cpp into relevant IDE of your choice and run. There are no other dependencies or classes that complement the functionality of this program.
